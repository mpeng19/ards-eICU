Queries to create a cohort of patients from eICU that have Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Schwager et al. identified ARDS cohort from eICU database as adults on mechanically-ventilation with poor oxygenation (defined as P/F ratio ≤ 300 and PEEP ≥ 5 for at least 8 h) and with edema secondary to respiratory failure rather than congestive heart failure, as indicated by ICD-9 codes recorded during ICU stay. We will address this limitation in using a similar definition to identify ARDS patients in the eICU dataset
