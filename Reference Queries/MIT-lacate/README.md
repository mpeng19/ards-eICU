### Inclusion Criteria

#### Question 1: Is Serum Lactate Racist?

To answer this first question, from the initial selection of sepsis patients patients (Sepsis-3) are filtered using the following inclusion criteria:

- Lactate Day 1 present
- Adult (â‰¥ 18 years of age)
- LoS > 24 h
- First Stay that meets the criteria from above

#### Question 2: If so, is that because of the treatment that the patients receive over the first ICU days?

And an additional criterion is applied:

- Lactate Day 2 present

At every step, we monitor the following demographics to see who is being excluded:

- Race
- Sex
- English proficiency (MIMIC only)
